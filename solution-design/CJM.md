## Moments of Truth

1. **First Search Results** — If no relevant tutors found, student leaves immediately
2. **Wizard Step 2-3** — Highest drop-off point; subjects/pricing is complex
3. **Booking Confirmation** — Must be instant and clear; uncertainty causes abandonment
4. **First Booking Received** — Tutor's validation moment; must be visible and actionable
